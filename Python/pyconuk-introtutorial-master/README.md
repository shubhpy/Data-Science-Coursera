# Pycon UK Introductory Tutorial

*This tutorial was delivered at PyCon UK 2014. For a more condensed version, please visit [github.com/savarin/python_for_ml](https://github.com/savarin/python_for_ml).*

## Installation Notes
This tutorial requires *pandas*, *scikit-learn* and *IPython* with the IPython Notebook. These can
be installed with *pip* by typing the following in terminal:

	pip install numpy pandas sklearn ipython

We will be reviewing the materials with the IPython Notebook. You should be able to type
	
	ipython notebook
	
in your terminal window and see the notebook panel load in your web browser.


## Downloading the Tutorial Materials

You can clone the material in this tutorial using git as follows:

	git clone git://github.com/savarin/pyconuk-introtutorial.git

Alternatively, there is a link above to download the contents of this repository as a zip
file.


## Static Viewing

The notebooks can be viewed in a static fashion using the [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org)
site, as per the links in the section below. However, we recommend reviewing them
interactively with the IPython Notebook.


## Presentation Format

The tutorial will start with data manipulation using pandas - loading data, and cleaning data. 
We'll then use scikit-learn to make predictions. By the end of the session, we would have
worked on the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted)
from start to finish, through a number of iterations in an increasing order of sophistication.
Weâ€™ll also have a brief discussion on cross-validation and making visualisations.

A [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/account/register) would be required for the
purposes of making submissions and reviewing our performance on the leaderboard.
